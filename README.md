# petmatcher
Look-Alike Pet Adoption is a web app that will match a user-input image with similar looking adoptable dogs available on PetFinder.com.

This is achieved using convolutional neural networks.  The already trained Inception Network is used and manipulated to build a classifier for dog breeds and to build a vector representation for each image.
